## üìã Executive Summary

**LifeOS** is a comprehensive life management operating system designed to help individuals systematically manage all aspects of their lives through a layered, hierarchical approach. The platform enables users to move from their current state (Point A) to their ideal life goals (Point T) by providing an integrated solution for task management, strategic planning, time management, and energy optimization.

### Vision Statement
Life OS aims to become the world's most effective and indispensable tool for personal development and goal achievement, supporting hundreds of thousands of people with thousands of different modules.

### Mission Statement
Our mission is to provide individuals with a digital environment where they can manage all areas of their lives with a holistic approach, transforming their scattered energy into focused power directed towards their goals.

---

## üéØ Problem Statement

### The Core Problem
Individuals with ideals and life goals face several critical challenges:

1. **Energy Fragmentation**: Focus on one area leads to neglect of other life areas, causing unsustainable progress
2. **Lack of Holistic View**: Existing tools (Notion, Trello, TickTick) provide narrow solutions without integrated methodology
3. **Time Management Complexity**: Irregular work schedules (e.g., shift work) make daily planning extremely difficult
4. **Unsustainability**: Intense focus on single projects leads to burnout and incomplete goals
5. **Missing Strategic Framework**: No systematic approach to bridge current state (Point A) to ideal goals (Point T)

### User Pain Points
- Cannot manage all life areas simultaneously
- Struggles to maintain work-life balance with irregular schedules
- Lacks tools for strategic life planning
- Cannot track progress across multiple life dimensions
- Existing tools are either too simple or too complex
- No integrated feedback mechanism for continuous improvement
